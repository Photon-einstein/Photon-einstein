### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Photon-einstein/Photon-einstein** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

👯 I’m a problem solver at heart, background from telecommunication and computer science, main interests in programming, software engineering/architecture and cryptography. 
🔭 I’m currently working on the software that interfaces with  the control algorithms of the wind power plants at Vestas.
🌱 I’m currently learning C#, Qt C++, cryptography and software architecture.
